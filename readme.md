# IMDB Movies - Search Box
This Replit demonstrates how a search box UI can be connected to a data endpoint. In this case, we are using a [freemium version of IMDB, provided by Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/imdb8/). To get your own API Key, you'll need to create a free account on RapidAPI.  

# Search Endpoint
Luckily, the Fremium version of IMDB includes a helpful endpoint that can be used as a basic search mechanism. The endpoint is called `title/v2/find` and it supports a wide variety of query parameters. It is thus well suited to performing searches. 

# Learning Prompts
- Can you find any other APIs that also include a documented search endpoint?
- Can you adapt this example to function as a search tool for a different API of your choosing?
- With reference to the [RapidAPI documentation](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/imdb8/), can you adapt this example to search for TV series instead of movies?
- How might you further optimize the user experience when searching for movies?
- How might you add a loading animation that shows only during the time when data is being fetched?
